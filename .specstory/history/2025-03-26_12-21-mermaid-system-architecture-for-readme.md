# Mermaid System Architecture for README (2025-03-26 20:21:17)

_**User**_

Can you draw a system architecture with Mermaid and add to `README.md`?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a system architecture diagram using Mermaid to visualize the Celery x Redis task queue system. I'll add it to the README.md file.

Let me first read the entire README to ensure I place the diagram in an appropriate location.

---

Read file: README.md

---

I'll add a system architecture diagram that shows the interaction between the frontend, backend, Redis, and Celery components. I'll place it right after the introduction and before the "Getting Started" section.

It seems the edit removed some important content. Let me fix that by adding back the removed sections.

I've added a comprehensive system architecture diagram using Mermaid that shows:

1. The main components of your system:
   - Frontend using Next.js
   - Backend using FastAPI
   - Celery Worker for task processing
   - Redis serving as both message broker and result backend

2. The flow of data:
   - HTTP requests from frontend to backend
   - Task submission from API to Redis queue
   - Task processing by Celery workers
   - Result storage in Redis
   - Result retrieval flow

3. Color coding for better visualization:
   - Frontend (Next.js) in React blue
   - Backend (FastAPI) in teal
   - Celery in its signature green
   - Redis components in Redis red

The diagram should help developers understand the system's components and their interactions at a glance. Is there anything specific about the architecture that you'd like me to clarify or modify?

_**User**_

Why there is "Unsupported markdown: list" when it rendering some arrows?

---

_**Assistant**_

The "Unsupported markdown: list" text appears to be a rendering issue in the image preview. This is happening because the image you're seeing is likely from a different Markdown renderer or editor that doesn't fully support all Mermaid syntax features.

Let me modify the Mermaid diagram to use a more widely supported syntax. I'll update the arrows to use standard Mermaid arrow notation.
